Capstone Project â€“ Task Manager CLI
What you should know: Combine variables, data types, strings, control flow, loops, functions, lists, dictionaries, nested data, multiple return values, error handling, and file handling into one cohesive program that simulates real backend logic.
Practice Prompt:
Build a Task Manager CLI where users can:
Add tasks with a title and priority (1 = High, 2 = Medium, 3 = Low).
View all tasks, grouped by priority, neatly formatted.
Mark tasks as complete by their number in the list.
Save tasks to tasks.txt and reload them on startup.
Handle invalid input (non-numbers, missing file, bad task index).
Prevent duplicate tasks by title (case-insensitive).
Bonus: Show completion percentage, allow deleting tasks, or export completed tasks to another file.
